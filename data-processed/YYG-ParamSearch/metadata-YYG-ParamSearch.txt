    We've built a simulator based on the SEIR model with learned parameters to make daily projections regarding 
    COVID-19 infections and deaths in all 50 US states and 40 countries. The model also accounts for individual 
    state-by-state reopenings and the resulting effects on infections and deaths.

    We've built a simulator based on the SEIR model with learned parameters to make daily projections regarding 
    COVID-19 infections and deaths in all 50 US states and 40 countries. The model also accounts for individual 
    state-by-state reopenings and the resulting effects on infections and deaths. The parameters/inputs of this 
    simulator are learned using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between the projected outputs 
    (projected daily deaths) and the actual results (reported daily deaths). Because the infections curve is unique 
    for every region, we let the model use each region's own data to learn the best set of parameters for that region. 
    This includes parameters such as: mortality rate, initial R_0, post-lockdown R, and the inflection date of any lockdowns. 
    Other variables such as the latency period, infectious period, and virus shedding period are fixed based on published 
    literature. After some additional validation techniques to minimize overfitting, we use the learned parameters to 
    simulate the future and make projections.
